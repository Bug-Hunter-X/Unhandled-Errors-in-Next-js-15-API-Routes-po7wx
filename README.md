# Unhandled Errors in Next.js 15 API Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 API routes where errors outside a try...catch block are not handled, resulting in silent failures or unhandled promise rejections.  The solution shows how to implement comprehensive error handling to prevent these issues.

## Problem

In the provided `data.js` file, the error handling is incomplete.  Errors occurring outside of the `try...catch` block within the `POST` logic are not caught, potentially leading to application instability.

## Solution

The `dataSolution.js` file demonstrates the improved solution.  By wrapping the entire API route handler in a `try...catch` block, all errors are captured, improving the application's robustness and providing better error reporting.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd unhandled-nextjs-api-errors`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
